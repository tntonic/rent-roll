## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RISK FACTORS

### Immediate Risks (0-3 months):
1. **Accelerating Vacancy Rate**
   - Current trajectory suggests 15%+ vacancy by year-end
   - $20.7M annual revenue at risk from current vacancy

2. **Lease Rollover Tsunami**
   - 2.9M SF expiring within 12 months (15% of portfolio)
   - Fund 2 particularly vulnerable with 17.5% near-term expiry

3. **Leasing Momentum Stalled**
   - Q2 leasing activity collapsed (50 new leases vs. 146 in Q1)
   - Net absorption deeply negative

### Structural Risks:
1. **Portfolio Contraction**
   - Fund 2 shrinking: -3.5% total SF over 6 months
   - Suggests asset dispositions or lease surrenders

2. **Tenant Retention Crisis**
   - 78 net tenant losses indicate systemic issues
   - Renewal rates appear to be declining

3. **Market Position Erosion**
   - Despite rent growth, occupancy losses suggest competitive disadvantage
   - May indicate property quality or location issues

3. **Revenue Protection Program**

   - Prioritize credit-worthy tenants
   - Implement rent escalations (3% annual)

### MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGY (3-6 Months):

1. **Portfolio Repositioning**
   - Evaluate underperforming assets for sale
   - Redeploy capital to stronger markets
   - Target 95%+ occupancy properties

2. **Capital Investment Program**
   - Allocate $10-20M for property improvements
   - Focus on amenities and modernization
