## ðŸš¨ RISK FACTORS

### High Priority Risks:
1. **Fund 2 Vacancy**: 31 properties have vacancy (18.6% of properties)
2. **Near-term Expirations**: Combined 2.8M SF expiring within 12 months
3. **Security Coverage**: Fund 2 has only 1.07 months coverage (vs 1.24 for Fund 3)
4. **Large Tenant Risk**: Several 100,000+ SF tenants expiring in next 24 months

### Medium Priority Risks:
